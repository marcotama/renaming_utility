This is a simple utility for renaming files in batch.
It is GUI based, and is pretty simple to use.

Features:
 - Preview of renaming
 - Prepend string
 - Append string
 - Append string before file extension
 - String replacement
 - Regular expression (Perl) replacement
 - Patternify button to try to infer a pattern in selected text

To run, enter `python rename.py`.

This application comes with no guarantees. Use at your own risk.
